# storageVault
StorageVault is a lightweight, secure, and customizable file-storage backend designed as a simplified version of Google Drive, ideal for small projects, educational use, or portfolio development. Built using Node.js and Express.js, it uses MongoDB with Mongoose for data modeling, Multer for file uploads, and GridFS for handling large files. Security is central to the system, with JWT-based authentication and bcrypt password hashing ensuring that only authorized users gain access. Metadata such as file name, size, type, owner, and upload date is stored in MongoDB, enabling efficient search and filter features. Strong validation and error handling make sure only permitted file types and sizes are uploaded while preventing unauthorized access.

A key highlight of the project is its role-based file-sharing mechanism, which allows users to share files securely using email-based access control. File owners retain complete control, with permissions to edit, delete, and share, while shared users are limited to viewing and downloading. The system is designed with scalability in mind, allowing optional cloud integration with AWS S3 or Cloudinary for production use. With RESTful API design and easy deployment options like Render or Heroku, StorageVault provides a practical demonstration of secure file management, combining simplicity with real-world backend concepts such as authentication, authorization, RBAC, and cloud-ready architecture.
