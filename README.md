# storageVault
In today’s digital era, the need for secure, scalable, and efficient file storage and sharing solutions has become increasingly critical. While major platforms like Google Drive and Dropbox offer comprehensive cloud storage, they are often complex, resource-intensive, and not easily customizable for small-scale or educational projects. This project addresses this gap by developing a lightweight backend system that allows users to upload, store, share, and manage files securely, effectively serving as a mini version of Google Drive.
The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js, with MongoDB as the database and Mongoose ODM for object modeling. File uploads are handled via Multer, with GridFS used for large file storage, and optionally, cloud storage integration through AWS S3 or Cloudinary for production-ready deployments. Security is a key focus: user authentication is implemented using JWT tokens, while bcrypt ensures that passwords are safely hashed. This ensures that only authorized users can access and manage files.
A central feature of the system is the role-based file sharing mechanism. Users can share files with other registered users using their email addresses, and access permissions are strictly enforced. File owners retain full control, including editing, deleting, and sharing, while shared users are typically restricted to viewing and downloading files. This mimics real-world role-based access control (RBAC), highlighting practical security practices in backend systems.
The project also includes search and filter functionalities, allowing users to locate files by name, type, or upload date, enhancing usability for large collections. Metadata such as file size, type, owner, and creation date is stored in MongoDB to support efficient querying and management. Comprehensive error handling and validation ensures that only permitted file types and sizes are uploaded, and unauthorized access is prevented.
Deployment considerations are addressed through MongoDB Atlas for database hosting and cloud platforms like Render or Heroku for backend deployment. The RESTful API design allows for easy integration with frontend frameworks such as React or Angular, making it suitable for full-stack expansion.
Overall, this project demonstrates a practical implementation of secure file management, sharing, and access control, providing hands-on experience with key backend concepts. While not as feature-rich as enterprise solutions, it effectively bridges the gap between basic file upload systems and full-scale cloud storage, making it highly relevant for small teams, educational purposes, and portfolio development.
